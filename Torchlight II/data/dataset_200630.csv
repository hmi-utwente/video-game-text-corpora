I've been doing some research, and have uncovered some interesting information about Vyrax, the ancient dragon who still dwells in the tower in Rivenskull Gorge. He was bound there by his brother, Thiss - whose spectral form lies beneath us in these Forgotten Halls.
The interesting bit is this - Vyrax has amidst his hoard a Heartfire Stone, which confers to its wielder the power of dragonfire. It is a rare and powerful artifact that would surely aid you.
